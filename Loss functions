PyTorch Loss-Input Confusion (Cheatsheet)
torch.nn.functional.binary_cross_entropy takes logistic sigmoid values as inputs
torch.nn.functional.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits takes logits as inputs
torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy takes logits as inputs (performs log_softmax internally)
torch.nn.functional.nll_loss is like cross_entropy but takes log-probabilities (log-softmax) values as inputs
